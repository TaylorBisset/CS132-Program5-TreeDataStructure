 Description:   This program is a simple and incomplete version 
                of the Binary Search Tree data structure that only
                includes 3 functions for the class.

Requirements:

- The insert member function should use loops to find the correct place for the new data 
(NOTE: duplicate numbers should not be added to the tree), 
and the print function must use recursion to print out the sorted data from the Tree.

- Inside the insert function you NEED to give the following “debug” output:

insert in empty tree        when this is the case
going left/right            when moving to the left or right down tree
inserting TRUE/FALSE        able to insert or not

{for an example look at the Program 6 Notes Tree.pdf in the Lecture section on Canvas}

- Insert the following numbers into the tree in this order:

                6   9    3    5    5   7   2   10   4   1   8

  ....and then output the data in sorted order and count from the list

  - turn in your main, the output, Tree.h, Tree.cpp, 
  and yes there should be a program header before main and a short class header before the Tree.h
